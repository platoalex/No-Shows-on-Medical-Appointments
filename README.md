Booking a medical appointments is easy; the hard part is actually showing up for them. This is a report of the investigation carried out in Brazil to show the role of the following factors: **Reminder SMS**, **Age**, and **appointment schedule** in the high record of patients' no shows in medical appointments. This report attempts to provide answers to the following questions: 1.  Do patients miss their appointments due to no reminder SMS recieved? 2.  What age bracket made their appointments more; is age a factor to decide whether or not a patient is likely to miss their appointment 3.  How far is the time between the sceduled date and appointment date for those patients that didnt make their appointment
